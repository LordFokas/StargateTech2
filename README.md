StargateTech 2
==============

[![Build Status](http://www.le-styx.net:8080/job/StargateTech2/badge/icon)](http://www.le-styx.net:8080/job/StargateTech2/) You can find builds here (they may not work but try them anyway :) )		

StargateTech 2 is a full (and proper) rewrite of StargateTech,
a mod based around technology and the Stargate TV shows,
essentially adding Stargate-themed technology to Minecraft.

Currently we are at version 0.7.5 for Minecraft 1.7.10
